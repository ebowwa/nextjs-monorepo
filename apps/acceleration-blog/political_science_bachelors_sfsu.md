This course is a variable topic course and may be taken more than once for credit. If taken more than once, any additional semesters count towards the Political Science Electives.

2
Moot Court may be repeated once for credit, but only 4 units may be applied to the Breadth requirement.

Note: A minimum of 30 upper-division units must be completed for the degree (including upper-division units required for the major, General Education, electives, etc.). A student can complete this major yet not attain the necessary number of upper-division units required for graduation. In this case, additional upper-division courses will be needed to reach the required total.

Complementary Studies
Twelve units of Complementary Studies are required of all candidates for the B.A. in Political Science. These units may come from any courses bearing a prefix other than PLSI that are not cross-listed with Political Science.

Bachelor of Arts in Political Science
Overview
At least 28 units for the major must be from upper-division courses (300–699).
Only three lower-division units may be counted towards the PLSI electives requirement. All other PLSI electives must be upper-division classes (300-level or above).
For a course to count towards the Political Science major, students must earn a grade of C- or better in all core, breadth, and culminating experience courses.
Political Science majors may take up to four units of political science coursework as credit no credit (CR/NC), as long as those units are part of their electives. All PLSI courses other than electives must be taken for a letter grade (i.e., A-, B, C+, etc.)
The GWAR (writing-emphasis) course must be taken in the Political Science Department, even if a student has completed a GWAR course in another department.
Students who want to do an independent study/special study must arrange it with faculty, submit a Petition for Course by Individual Study (PLSI 699) form, and have at least a 3.0 grade-point average. Independent Study units count only as electives.
Program Learning Outcomes
Demonstrate knowledge of the American political system, comparative knowledge of diverse political systems and dynamics around the world, and of a variety of theoretical traditions from different cultures and societies.
Demonstrate critical thinking skills and proficiency in expressing complex ideas and arguments through writing, proficiency in political research and analysis, an ability to conduct basic empirical analysis in political topics, and an ability to do textual exegesis in written work.
In their senior culminating experience, students demonstrate an ability to develop thoughtful and persuasive research projects of their own in an area of political science.
Demonstrate citizenship skills, including an ability to appreciate human diversity, communicate ideas effectively, engage in community life, and link theory to practice by applying political science knowledge to actual problem-solving and community service.


Introduction to General Education
The major provides in-depth study in one subject matter, often one directly related to a particular career. General Education (GE), on the other hand, involves study in breadth -- for acquiring knowledge and skills for a range of future experiences throughout life, for providing the intellectual agility for moving from one career to another, and for making future contributions in a number of possible communities. The University requires students to complete 48 units of General Education requirements (GE).

General Education Breadth requirements have been designed to complement the major program and electives completed by each baccalaureate candidate, to assure that graduates have made noteworthy progress toward becoming truly educated persons. These requirements are designed to provide the knowledge, skills, experiences, and perspectives that will enable SF State students to expand their capacities to take part in a wide range of human interests and activities; to confront personal, cultural, moral, and social problems that are an inevitable part of human life; and to cultivate both the requisite skills and enthusiasm for lifelong learning. Courses approved for GE Breadth are responsive to the need for students to have developed knowledge of, or skills related to, quantitative reasoning, information literacy, intellectual inquiry, global awareness and understanding, human diversity, civic engagement, communication competence, ethical decision-making, environmental systems, technology, lifelong learning and self-development, and physical and emotional health throughout a lifetime.

Areas A through E of GE contain only lower-division classes and should be taken in the first two years of college. They provide basic skills as well as breadth in a variety of disciplinary areas. Area A of GE is designed to improve student’s basic skills in communication in English (oral and written) and critical thinking. Area B of GE provides a breadth of knowledge about the physical and life sciences, including laboratory experiences. Area B also provides students an opportunity to expand their mathematics and quantitative reasoning skills. Area C of GE focuses on the Arts and Humanities and gives students a chance to explore the Humanities through literature. Area D of GE covers the social sciences and includes the US History and Government requirements. Area E courses are the second part of the first-year experience. The courses cover rhetorical knowledge, the writing process, information literacy, and reflection and metacognition.

Area F contains both lower and upper-division courses and is designed to widen a student's knowledge of the various ethnicities that make up our world.

Upper-Division General Education is designed to provide students with the opportunity to integrate and apply the knowledge, skills, and insights gained from their lower-division General Education courses. All students must complete a total of 9 units with one course in each of the following CSU-mandated groupings of domains of knowledge and inquiry:

 Upper-Division Physical and/or Life Sciences (Area UD-B),
 Upper-Division Arts and/or Humanities (Area UD-C), and
 Upper-Division Social Sciences (Area UD-D).
A detailed listing of all General Education areas and courses begins on General Education Lower Division. You can find specific areas of our GE program by visiting the General Education Table of Contents.
