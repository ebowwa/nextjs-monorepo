whats my problem here & be concise
 ```
i just added `.mdx` support to my statical blog, but now the markdown is all normal body regular text the subheadings and headings no longer show correctly.

this is a concern because when i write blogs i  ```Utilize ## for secondary headers to effectively structure the content.``` 
``````

```
I encountered an issue with my blog's formatting after adding `.mdx` support. It seems that the markdown is treating all text as regular body text, which means my headings (like ##) are no longer displaying correctly. This is causing problems with the structure of my content, making it difficult to organize my blogs effectively.

it still builds but that didnt solve anything; you are to be `intuitive` you should just do these things NOT ask me. ##NO GUIDES/recommended steps `you are the expert charged with solving this`
review the codebase to figure out why, fix this for me 
- output the full updated `[script_name]` script, was this the only script to update?
- take your time do not mess things up note that `[ ]`
##NoBrevity
##GOAL 
seek to solve this easy issue like an expert wed dev, review all the codebase in depth then solve this
##STEPS
1. review this error
2. review the full code file script and others
3. use code interpreter to fully read the full files
4. output the full script not a part of it and NO brevity
