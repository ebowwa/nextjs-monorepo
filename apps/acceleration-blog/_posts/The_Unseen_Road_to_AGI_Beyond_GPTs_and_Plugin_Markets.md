The landscape of artificial intelligence is vast and ever-changing, with GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) representing only a small fraction of the innovations that continue to unfold. As we navigate towards the elusive goal of AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, the conversation naturally gravitates towards the democratization of AI and the tools that enable us to interface with this technology.

The buzz surrounding AI plugin markets heralded a revolution that promised to empower even those with minimal coding expertise to harness the power of AI. This excitement reached new heights with the introduction of platforms that allowed users to create custom functions or "plugins" for their AI interactions. The idea was simple yet profound: use natural language to direct an AI assistant, which could then predict and execute the correct action using a suite of tools. The practical applications seemed limitless, from automating mundane tasks to streamlining complex workflows.

Despite the initial hype, this model faced significant hurdles. While the concept was alluring, the reality was that barriers remained. True accessibility was not just a matter of providing the tools but also ensuring that people had the knowledge and resources to use them effectively. The Bay Area's tech-savvy residents, or those with well-connected circles, might find these tools within reach. However, for the rest of the world, these innovations remained just out of grasp.

As 2023 waned, the attention shifted from the plugin paradigm to a new model: the GPT store and the proliferation of custom OpenAI-hosted GPTs. This shift represented more than just a change in platform; it symbolized a deeper evolution in the AI ecosystem. The focus was no longer on individual tools but on the ecosystem as a whole, and on creating a more unified interface for AI interaction.

The philosophical shift accompanying this transition cannot be overstated. The GPT store model challenges the very notion of proprietary AI, suggesting a future where AI-generated content and the prompts that produce them are part of the public domain. This is a world where the uniqueness of an AI's output is not gated behind intellectual property rights but is freely available for iteration and improvement.

In this future, the potential for a saturated market of AI-driven tools and services looms large. The question then becomes not about the availability of AI capabilities but rather their uniqueness and the value they add. As AI becomes increasingly commoditized, the differentiating factor may well be the user experience and the creative application of these tools.

The "Gorilla" project by UC Berkeley stands as a testament to the ongoing innovations in the field. This open-source, state-of-the-art Large Language Model surpasses even GPT-4 in its ability to write API calls, highlighting the advancements being made beyond the confines of proprietary models. It underscores a trend towards openness and collaboration in AI development, which could potentially accelerate our journey towards AGI.

This journey is not without its challenges. The open nature of AI prompts and the outputs they generate raises questions about the protection of intellectual property and the ethics of AI use. It also begs the question of how to foster a diverse ecosystem of AI tools that can coexist without leading to a homogenized landscape.

Yet, there's a palpable excitement about what this means for the future of AI. As the distinctions between different AI models begin to blur, we inch closer to a more integrated and intuitive AI experience. One where the lines between human and machine creativity are not just blurred but are seamlessly interwoven, creating a symbiotic relationship that could unlock new realms of innovation and exploration.

As we look towards this horizon, it's clear that the road to AGI is not a straight path but a winding one, filled with unexpected turns and new vistas. It's a journey that promises to redefine not just technology but our very relationship with it.
