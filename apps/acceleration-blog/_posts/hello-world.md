Hello, world. It's Elijah. 

Today, I invite you into my world, a world where traditional paths of learning are but a speck in the rearview mirror, where the pursuit of knowledge is unbound by the shackles of conventional education. My journey is not a linear tale; it's a tapestry woven from threads of curiosity, relentless self-teaching, and a relentless drive to understand the the world I wish to give back to.

I grew up in Fremont, CA, amidst the technological heartbeat of Silicon Valley and San Francisco. Yet, my path was not paved with the silver stones of privilege. No nepotism, no inherited wealth – just a burning desire to decode the world around me. Growing up I took care of my brothers while watching my parents work nights, and my extended family struggle to achieve more. 

My journey into programming and machine learning has been a self-directed exploration, fueled by resources scattered across the digital universe. From Python libraries to Raspberry Pi projects, from grappling with the intricacies of Word2Vec and LSTM models to the struggles with LeetCode problems, every step has been a lesson, every failure a stepping stone. I see AI not just as a tool, but as a partner in this journey, a guide helping me unlock doors I never knew existed.

But why am I doing all this? Why tread this solitary path? It's because I believe in the power of knowledge, in the democratization of learning. In a world where AI and machine learning are rapidly reshaping our reality, I see a future where knowledge is free and accessible to all for any curious mind willing to explore. This blog is my canvas, and on it, I paint my thoughts, my experiments, my successes, and my stumbles.

So, here's to the journey ahead – a journey of discovery, of challenge, of endless learning. Whether you're a fellow self-learner, a tech enthusiast, or simply someone intrigued by the mysteries of AI, I welcome you to join me. Let's explore this vast, uncharted digital universe together. Let's learn, let's grow, and let's push the boundaries of what's possible.

Welcome to my world.

-Elijah
